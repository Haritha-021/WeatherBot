# WeatherBot
Our project focused on the creation of a serverless chatbot capable of providing weather information through both text and voice-based interactions. 

By utilizing cloud technologies, we were able to develop an intuitive voice interface for seamless user interaction. 

Additionally, we implemented HTML and CSS to create an attractive interface design. 

The project relied on various AWS services, such as Lex, Lambda, Cloudfront, API Gateway, S3, and DynamoDB, to support its functionality.
